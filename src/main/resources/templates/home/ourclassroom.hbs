									</span>Our classroom is located on the first floor of Washington Elementary School, in Aurora Illinois.
									 Aurora is made up of 55.78% Caucasian, 42.7% Latino, 
									10.03% African American, and 7.21% Asian. The average income for a household is $60,809. <br/>
										In our classroom, this year we will have 25 students. I will be splitting students up into equal groups of five. Each group will have a group name will be a color â€“ purple, blue, red, green, yellow, and orange. The significance of the colors is for students to collaborate with others and to form groups faster. Students will sit within their groups and in clusters. I will be switching up groups at the beginning of every month. 
										In addition, we will have a classroom library in the corner of the room with a rocking chair.In this area, we will do all of our reading and this is where we will have our read aloud. Next to the reading 
									center we will have a science area where we will be doing all of our science experiments.

									</span> In the front of the classroom
									 we have our whiteboard, calendar, and our carpet. This is where we will have carpet and calendar time. Next to this I have my desk.
									  This is way I can keep an eye on the students and also be easily accessible to them. In the back of the 
									room we have a couple of computers for students to practice typing on and to expose students to technology. <br/>
									 In our classroom, we have weekly job. Students will be given a job every week to do and this helps our classroom run smoothly and also helps student learn responsibility. I have found in the past that students really enjoy this and look forward to receiving new jobs and helping the class.
